\f0\fs24 \cf0 UI design:\
-everyone thinks you can drag objects from inventory\
-bigger buttons/more clickable\
\
-some confusion about what the objects are\
-expected curved ramp to be seesaw\
-not using reset ball very much\
-the magnet being a bitch is a bitch\
-dragging the trampoline is tough because of the shape of the body\
-the shape of the ramps is kinda weird\
-record best stars on level select screen\
-music/sound\
-have pictures in instructions\
\
bugs:\
inventory got eaten\
win screen isn't appearing\
magnet behavior\
button highlighting funky\
multitouch does bad things\
\
other physics group advice:\
get rid of debug draw  *****************************\
\
dragging:\
drag into inventory trash can = delete ***********************\
drag off borders = bounce back to original position *******************\
shouldn't be able to drag objects on top of each other (though some overlap is okay)\
\
magnet:\
hamster should have metal hat\
\
popup for new objects\
\
sit curved ramp in rectangle (half-pipe style) so people don't think it's a seesaw\
\
"Get the Ball Rolling!" isn't clear\
\
final portal should be a cupcake (with a pipe?)\
\
score: fewer objects = higher score?\
\
level 1-3: hard in the annoying way that everything has to be exactly perfect\
\
positive:\
count is intuitive\
